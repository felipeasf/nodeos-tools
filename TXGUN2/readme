TX Party 

0. timedatectl set-timezone UTC

1. Check if server time is syncing (use ntpdate or better way is to install ntp daemon: `apt install ntp`)

2. Set system time to UTC: sudo timedatectl set-timezone UTC

3. Create Jungle 2 tester account https://monitor.jungletestnet.io/#account

4. Announce new account in https://t.me/Jungle2_StressTest .  You will receive CPU stake for testing.

5. Download TX Gun Script (link will be provided shortly)

6. Edit Config 00_CONFIG.conf:
   -- ENDPOINT - change to endpoint you woud like to use to push txs
   -- PRIV_KEY_TO_SIGN_TX  - insert your new tester account priv active key (it will use to sign tx, as cleos sign works only with keys)
   -- DO_TRANSFER - 0 or 1. If 1 send transfer, else send message to contract and this action do nothing.
   -- TRANSFER_FROM - account name you created for testing
   -- TRANSFER_TO - account transfer receiver (using only if DO_TRANSFER=1)
   -- TRANSFER_AMOUNT - amount you woud like to transfer (using only if DO_TRANSFER=1)
   -- TRANSFER_MSG - Message Included in TXs
   -- TXS_PER_PUSH - How meny transactions include in one push (max 1000)
   -- THREADS - How many pushes do in separate threads (for example 10: 10*1000 = 10 000 transaction will be sent)
   -- REPEAT - How many time repeat the procedure.

!!! Scripts works in two steps. First it prepares TXs and stores them in files. After it waits until start of *0 or *5 minute and pushes all transactions in one time. So all party participants will send TXs at one time! (That’s why time sync is important!!)

7. Before start use test (TX_GUN_test.sh) scipt to send 1 tx immediately and check if everything is configured well.

8. If everything is ready, you can start ./TX_GUN_start.sh but be sure that other participants are ready :)


P.S.: Please do not share this script to public access - we don’t know yet what damage it can do..
